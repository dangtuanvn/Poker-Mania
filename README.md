# Poker-Mania
This game is a showcase of my understanding of Java programming language and some of its design patterns.

As this is my hobby project so I will have some commits here and there over a long period of time. Hopefully this project will provide a good insight or be a source of knowledge for anyone who might be interested in the mentioned topics.

The first wave of commits will take a while since I am going to document some UML diagrams before actually typing any code. If you perhaps stumble on this repo during the development phase and have an idea or two, please do not afraid to comment or contact me at dangtuan7112@gmail.com

Cheers!~
